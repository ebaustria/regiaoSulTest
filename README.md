# regiaoSul
A set of files for visualizing long-distance simulations from The-ONE

## Requirements
* Python 3.4+

## Getting Started
Clone the necessary repositories:

```
git clone https://github.com/ebaustria/regiaoSul.git
git clone https://github.com/ebaustria/deck.gl.git
git clone https://github.com/ebaustria/the-one.git
```

Navigate to the-one and switch to the correct branch:

```
cd the-one
git checkout longDistance
```

**Note**: Make sure that ```Report.report1``` on line 105 of ```the-one/default_settings.txt``` is set to ```LocalCoordinatesReport```. 

Compile the code and run the simulation:

```
./compile.sh
./one.sh regiaoSul_settings.txt
```

**Note**: If you are using Java 11, you will need to compile the program with ```./compileJava11.sh```. ```the-one/README.txt``` or ```the-one/README.md``` can be consulted for more information on compiling and running the-ONE, if necessary. It may be necessary to remove the flight recorder in order to run the simulation. If this is the case, open ```the-one/one.sh``` and remove ```-XX:+FlightRecorder  -XX:StartFlightRecording=duration=60s,filename=myrecording.jfr ``` from the file. Afterwards, it should work. When the simulation is finished, it will write a report. Each line of the report has the following form: vehicle name, local coordinates, timestamp. The vehicle name is the name of the vehicle in question, the local coordinates are a pair of local coordinates used in the ONE, and the timestamp is the simulation time at which the vehicle is located at the local coordinates in question.

Open ```the-one/reports```. Find the aforementioned report. It should be the most recent report and its name should end with ```LocalCoordinatesReport.txt```. If it is your first time running the simulation, it will be the only file in ```the-one/reports```. Rename the report as ```local_coordinates_brazil.txt```. Move this file to the ```regiaoSul``` repository.

Next, open ```the-one/data/regiaoSul```. Find ```stations.wkt``` and ```cities.wkt``` and copy them to the ```regiaoSul``` repository. Do not change the name of either file.

Navigate to ```regiaoSul```, create a virtual environment, and install the required dependencies:

```
cd ..
cd regiaoSul
python3 -m venv --without-pip .venv
curl -sS https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | .venv/bin/python
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Creating JSON Files:
Run ```readMap.py```:

```
python3 -m readMap
```

On line 136, ```readMap.py``` writes a file called ```gps_coordinates_brazil.csv```. This file is a mapping of the local coordinates of each node (used in the ONE and taken from ```local_coordinates_brazil.txt```) to that node's corresponding GPS coordinates. Running ```readMap.py``` also writes a WKT linestring file for each route that consists of GPS coordinates. These files are written on line 132. The WKT linestring file names have the format ```route_name + _gps_nodes.wkt```.

Run ```json_generator.py```:

```
python3 -m json_generator
```

The first function call in ```json_generator.py``` reads ```local_coordinates_brazil.txt``` and ```gps_coordinates_brazil.csv```, parses the data in each file, and uses it to build a list of dictionaries that each contain a list of GPS coordinates and a list of corresponding timestamps for a vehicle. This list of dictionaries is then written to a JSON file called ```trips.json``` that can be used to visualize vehicle movement in deck.gl. The second function call in ```json_generator.py``` reads in each of the WKT linestring files, parses the data in them, and creates a list of dictionaries that each contain a route name, a color, and a list of the route's GPS coordinates in linestring form. This list is then written to a JSON file called ```routes_brazil.json``` that can be used to visualize the public transit lines in deck.gl. The third function call in ```json_generator.py``` reads ```stations.wkt``` and ```cities.wkt```, parses the data in each file, and builds a list of dictionaries that each contain a single pair of GPS coordinates. This list is then written to a JSON file called ```stops.json``` that can be used to visualize public transit stops in deck.gl. The third function call reads ```arrivals.txt``` (includes timestamps for when vehicles arrive at stops in the ONE) and ```gps_coordinates_brazil.csv```, parses the data in each file, and builds a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains a vehicle name, a set of coordinates, a single timestamp, and a color (RGB format). The list is written to a file called ```arrivals.json```, which is used to visualize the arrivals of vehicles at public transit stops in deck.gl. The final function call reads ```created_messages.txt``` and ```gps_coordinatesbrazil.csv``` and creates a file called ```creating_message.json``` which is used to visualize the creation of messages in the-ONE. This part of the visualization is still a work in progress.

## Visualizing the Data
Create a remote repository and add it if you haven't already. Stage the five JSON files from the previous section to be committed, commit them, and push them to your remote:

<pre>
git remote add <i>remote_name</i> https://github.com/<i>user</i>/<i>repo</i>.git
git add trips.json
git add routes_brazil.json
git add stops.json
git add arrivals.json
git add creating_message.json
git commit -m "<i>message</i>"
git push <i>remote_name</i> master
</pre>

deck.gl uses special classes called layers to visualize datasets. Each layer class produces a different effect. In this visualization, we use five different layers: TripsLayer, PathLayer, IconLayer, ScatterplotLayer, and TextLayer. Each of the JSON files we've created needs to be passed to one of these layers so they can be visualized.

Open ```deck.gl/examples/website/trips/app.js```. We need to modify ```app.js``` to get it to visualize our data.

First, make sure the necessary layer classes are imported at the top of the file:

```
import {TripsLayer} from '@deck.gl/geo-layers';
import {PathLayer} from '@deck.gl/layers';
import {IconLayer} from '@deck.gl/layers';
import {TextLayer} from '@deck.gl/layers';
import {ScatterplotLayer} from '@deck.gl/layers';
```

You will need a mapbox token to see the base map. Create a mapbox token at https://www.mapbox.com/ if you don't already have one and set the token in ```app.js``` directly beneath the imports:

```
const MAPBOX_TOKEN = "<i>your_mapbox_token</i>";
```

**Note**: Be sure to enclose the mapbox token in quotes.

Next, we need to provide the raw data URLs of our JSON arrays to ```app.js```. We will define constant references to the raw data URLs within the ```DATA_URL``` constant. Open the raw data for each JSON file in the remote GitHub repository you have set up and assign each raw data URL as a string to a constant in ```DATA_URL```. For example, you might define the constant reference to ```trips.json``` as:

```
TRIPS: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebaustria/regiaoSul/master/trips.json'
```

In general, ```DATA_URL``` and the constants defined within it should have the following structure:

```
const DATA_URL = {
  <i>CONST_NAME</i>: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<i>your_github_profile</i>/<i>your_remote_repository</i>/<i>branch</i>/<i>your_data.json</i>',
  ...
};
```

**Note**: Do not forget to add commas in between constant references.

Scroll down to ```export default function App```. At the beginning of the function, use the previously defined constant references to define variables to pass to each layer instance:

```
<i>data_variable</i> = DATA_URL.<i>CONST_NAME</i>,
...
```

The final step is to initialize each layer instance in the ```layer``` constant and provide its respective properties. The correspondence between the datasets and the layers is as follows:

* trips.json --> TripsLayer
* routes_brazil.json --> PathLayer
* stops.json --> IconLayer
* arrivals.json --> ScatterplotLayer
* creating_message.json --> TextLayer

The following sections provide examples of how to initialize the necessary layers within ```layer```, as well as some additional information.

### TripsLayer
```app.js``` already includes an instance of TripsLayer that can be used in the visualization with minimal changes:

```
    new TripsLayer({
      id: 'trips',
      data: trips,
      getPath: d => d.path,              //do not edit
      getTimestamps: d => d.timestamps,  //do not edit
      getColor: [253, 128, 93],
      opacity: 1,
      widthMinPixels: 3,
      rounded: true,
      trailLength,                       //do not edit
      currentTime: time,                 //do not edit
      getWidth: 3,
      shadowEnabled: false
    }),
```

**Note**: ```data:``` is the property that determines which dataset the layer uses. Every layer needs to be provided with a data property.

The name that is assigned to ```data:``` should correspond to one of the URL variables you defined in the ```App``` function. ```trips``` is passed to the data property of TripsLayer by default. If you gave the constant reference that corresponds to ```trips.json``` a different name in ```App```, make sure you pass that name to the data property instead of ```trips```.

### PathLayer
The general template for the PathLayer's properties is:

```
    new PathLayer({
      id: '<i>layer_id</i>',
      data: <i>your_variable_name</i>,
      widthMinPixels: 3,    //deck.gl will not render a path thinner than 3 pixels no matter how far the user zooms out
      rounded: true,
      getPath: e => e.path,   //do not edit
      getColor: e => e.color,  //do not edit
      getWidth: 3           //the width of each path in meters
    }),
```

### IconLayer
The general template for the IconLayer's properties is:

```
    new IconLayer({
      id: '<i>layer_id</i>',
      data: <i>your_variable_name</i>,
      iconAtlas: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visgl/deck.gl-data/master/website/icon-atlas.png',   //do not edit
      iconMapping: ICON_MAPPING,  //do not edit
      getIcon: g => 'marker',     //do not edit
      sizeScale: 10,
      getPosition: g => g.coordinates,  //do not edit
      getSize: g => 3,
      getColor: g => g.color,           //do not edit
      getPixelOffset: [0, -10]
    }),
```

Also make sure to add the following lines below ```DATA_URL```:

```
const ICON_MAPPING = {
  marker: {x: 0, y: 0, width: 128, height: 128, mask: true}
};
```

### ScatterplotLayer
The general template for the ScatterplotLayer's properties is:

```
    new ScatterplotLayer({
      id: '<i>layer_id</i>',
      data: <i>your_variable_name</i>,
      radiusScale: 6,
      radiusMinPixels: 0,     //the minimum circle radius in pixels that deck.gl will display
      radiusMaxPixels: 100,   //the maximum circle radius in pixels that deck.gl will display
      getPosition: d => d.coordinates,                         //do not edit
      getRadius: d => isVisible(d.timestamp, time, 30, 600),   //only edit last two parameters in function call
      getFillColor: d => [253, 128, 93],
      updateTriggers: {
        getRadius: [d => isVisible(d.timestamp, time, 30, 600)]   //only edit last two parameters in function call
      },
      transitions: {
        getRadius: {
          type: 'spring',     //do not edit
          stiffness: 0.01,
          damping: 0.15,
          duration: 100,
          enter: d => [0]     //do not edit
        }
      }
    }),
```

### TextLayer
The general template for the TextLayer's properties is:

```
    new TextLayer({
      id: '<i>layer_id</i>',
      data: <i>your_variable_name</i>,
      getPosition: d => d.coordinates,    //do not edit
      getText: d => d.notification,       //do not edit
      getSize: 16,
      getColor: d => [0, 0, 0, isVisible(d.timestamp, time, 15, 255)],     //only edit last two parameters in function call
      backgroundColor: [255, 255, 255],
      getTextAnchor: 'middle',            //determines where the text is displayed relative to the object's position ('start', 'middle', or 'end')
      getAlignmentBaseline: 'center',     //determines where the text is displayed relative to the object's position ('top', 'center', or 'bottom')
      updateTriggers: {
        getColor: [d => [0, 0, 0, isVisible(d.timestamp, time, 15, 255)]]  //only edit last two parameters in function call
      }
    }),
```

A functioning version of ```app.js``` is located in the ```regiaoSul``` repository and can be consulted for an example.

**Note**: The TextLayer is still being worked on.

**Note**: Each of the layers presented here has additional properties that have not been included in any of the above code samples. The information provided here is only intended to help users create a working visualization. https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/layers can be consulted for more information on deck.gl's layers, their properties, and how to modify them.

**Note**: If you would like to do a simpler version of this step, you should be able to navigate to ```deck.gl/examples/website/trips``` and replace the version of ```app.js``` that is located there with the version of ```app.js``` that is located in ```regiaoSul```.
